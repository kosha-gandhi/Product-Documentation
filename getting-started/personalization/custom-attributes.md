# Custom Attributes

Custom Attributes may be added for all user entities in your Cymmetri Platform. This allows organizations to add custom user attributes that are used across the applications in the organization.&#x20;

For example, your organization has a custom attribute that captures and uses the local language of your employees and vendors to provide local services. This attribute may be stored in your Active Directory and may need to be synchronized to your organization’s other applications during the course of an employee or vendor’s employment.&#x20;

Cymmetri platform allows the administrator to define custom attributes on a tenant-wide level.&#x20;

Custom attributes can be used at various places, like when **creating a user**, **as a filter when searching for users**, and **are visible in the other sections of user info**

    1. _Name/ Key:_ refers to the label assigned to the custom attribute.
    2. _Description:_ allows you to provide additional details or notes about the custom attribute for reference and clarity.     &#x20;
    3. _Status:_ Allows activation of the custom attribute. Only if it is set to active is the attribute available to use in the User Object.

    _Note: A custom attribute, once created, can only be set to inactive; it cannot be deleted._
