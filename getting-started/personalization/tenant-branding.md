# Tenant Branding

Tenant branding in Cymmetri allows you to personalize and enhance the visual identity of your environment. With tenant branding, you can customize the appearance of your platform, including logos, color schemes, and even tailored messages, aligning it with your organization's branding guidelines.&#x20;

This not only creates a cohesive and professional user experience but also reinforces your brand's presence throughout the Cymmetri environment. It's a powerful tool for organizations looking to maintain a consistent and recognizable image while utilizing Cymmetri's identity and management capabilities.

The Cymmetri platform allows a certain level of customization to your tenant from the administration panel. This includes the ability to modify the default Cymmetri branding scheme to your own Organization’s branding scheme.

1. Your Organization Name and Tagline
2. Your Organization Logo
3. Your Organization Branding Colors (Primary, Secondary, Accent Colors)&#x20;

### Configuring your tenant branding
