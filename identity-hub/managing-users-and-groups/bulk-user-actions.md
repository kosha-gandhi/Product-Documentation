# Bulk User Actions

This feature allows administrators to perform multiple user management tasks simultaneously, streamlining the process of managing a large number of user accounts. The following actions can be performed in bulk, namely:

* Lock User
* Unlock User
* Activate User
* Deactivate User
* Delete User

**Lock User:** This action disables a user's access to all services and applications without deleting their account. A locked user cannot log in until their account is unlocked.

**Unlock User:** This action restores a user's access to their account, allowing them to log in and access services.

**Activate User**: This action makes a user account active, allowing the user to access services. This is typically used for newly created accounts or accounts that were previously deactivated.

**Deactivate User**: This action temporarily suspends a user's account, preventing them from logging in or accessing any services. The account and its data are retained and can be reactivated later.

**Delete User:** This action permanently removes a user account and all associated data from the system. This action is irreversible.

#### Bulk Group Assignment

This feature allows administrators to assign multiple users to a local group in a single operation. The process is a two-step workflow to ensure accuracy and prevent accidental changes.

**Step 1: Review User Selection**

* The administrator selects a group of users to be assigned to a specific local group.
* A review screen is presented, displaying a list of the selected users.
* The administrator can add or remove users from this list before proceeding.

**Step 2: Finalize Assignment**

* The administrator confirms the final list of users to be assigned to the group.
* The system then performs the assignment action for all users on the finalized list.
* A confirmation or action summary is typically displayed, showing the status of the bulk assignment.

**Bulk Action Dashboard**

A dedicated dashboard provides a summary of all recent bulk actions. This dashboard allows administrators to review:

* The type of action performed (e.g., "Lock User," "Assign Local Group").
* The total number of users affected by the action.
* The status of the action (e.g., "Completed," "In Progress," "Failed").
* A detailed log of each user's outcome, including any errors that may have occurred.

This dashboard provides a transparent overview of all bulk operations, ensuring accountability and easy troubleshooting.
