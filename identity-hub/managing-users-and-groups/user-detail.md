<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (111).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

    <figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (808).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>


* **Assigning New Applications:** Should you need to add more applications to your list, the process is simple. Just click on the **Add New Button** located on the interface. This action opens up a selection window where you can choose additional applications that you wish to assign to the user.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (112).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* **Searching for Applications:** To facilitate ease of access, a search function is incorporated into the interface. This feature allows you to quickly find specific applications by typing the name or part of it into the search bar, saving you time and effort from manually scrolling through the list of applications.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (113).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Note:** _In instances where an application has not been successfully assigned, the interface provides direct actions to resolve the issue without needing to navigate away from the page. Each application tile includes an (_⋮) _menu with two options:_

* _**Retry:** If an application's assignment process encounters an issue, you can select this option to attempt assigning the application again._
* _**Delete:** If the assignment issue remains unresolved or if you no longer wish to keep the application, you can choose to remove the application from your list entirely._

## **Groups Page**

This page provides an overview of the groups to which a user is assigned, reflecting the current status of each.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (110).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

#### Viewing Assigned Groups and Their Status

Upon accessing the page, users are presented with a list of all the groups to which they are currently assigned. Each entry includes the **group's name, description**, **number of users in the group** and **number of applications assigned to the group**.

#### Editing Group&#x20;

#### Removing Group Memberships

Equally important is the capacity to manage the departure from groups, which is facilitated by the Delete Group option. Also found within the ellipse (⋮) menu, this feature does not delete the group itself but rather unassigns the user from the selected group. This action ensures the user's access and permissions within the application are precisely tailored, maintaining security and relevance.

## &#x20;User Activity Log Page

This page shows the user-specific audit log for all the various actions and activities performed by the user. This may include all activities related to the user, as shown below

## User's  Settings Page

**Status:**

You can change the status of users and accounts in our system to manage access and control.

#### For Users:

* **Locked**: Stops user access temporarily. This is used for security reasons or if there are too many failed login attempts.
* **Unlocked**: Gives access back to the user, allowing them to log in and use the system.

#### For Accounts:

* **Active**: The account is in use, and everything works normally.
* **Inactive**: Temporarily not in use, but can be activated again.
* **Delete**: The account is deleted and moved to suspended accounts

#### **Reset Password**

The administrator has three distinct options for configuring the password reset process, allowing them to choose a method that best fits the organization's security policies and workflow.

1. **Generate Password**: This option allows the user's manager to generate a random, one-time password.&#x20;
2. **Generate Password and Send to User's Email**: With this option, the manager triggers the password reset, and the system automatically generates a new password and sends it directly to the user's registered email address.&#x20;
3.  **Send Reset Password Link to User's Email**: This is the most secure option. The manager initiates the process, but instead of a password, the system sends a secure, time-sensitive "Reset Password" link to the user's email. The user must click the link to create a new password.

### Trusted Devices by User

This list of devices trusted based on the configuration done by the admin is listed on this page with the following information about each device: **Browser**, **OS**, **Created At**, **Trusted**, **Action**(remove device)

In Cymmetri,  one of the features available to users is the ability to delegate self-service access. This capability enables users to assign their access rights and responsibilities to other users temporarily. Ideal for scenarios such as vacations, business trips, or whenever a user needs someone else to manage their duties without forfeiting their credentials or compromising security.

This page shows the delegation provided by the user; this may be currently in progress or the delegation that was last completed.

The page shows the status of the Delegation (INPROGRESS, COMPLETED), Designated To, Start Date, End Date, and the list of Excluded Applications(if any)
