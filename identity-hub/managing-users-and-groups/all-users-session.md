This functionality allows administrators to gain insights into ongoing user activities, view active sessions, and, if necessary, terminate or manage these sessions for security, compliance, or administrative purposes.&#x20;

The admin can terminate all the user sessions at once or select them individually. The page also has a search option for the admin to search the desired user session.
