# Setting up Delegation

Delegation as a process in the Cymmetri platform refers to the ability of any end-user to delegate their responsibilities to any other end-user on the platform.\
\
As such, delegation provides the ability to the delegatee to perform various actions, including Single Sign On, Application Requests, managing workflows by providing approvals, and performing Cymmetri administrative actions (if the delegator has the required permissions on the platform), among other actions. However, the login flow for the delegatee stays the same.

### **Configuring the delegation on your tenant**

Access the Delegation administration panel, by clicking on the **Configuration** left-hand side menu item and then clicking on the **Delegations** menu item.

For any user to be able to delegate their work to other users, the user should be added to the delegation users list; To Add Users to the delegation list so that they can delegate their activities, click on the Assign New button and select one or more users to add to this list.

User and Assignee Consent

The User and Assignee Consent sections allow organizations to align task delegation practices with their unique policies. This customizable feature empowers administrators to define specific consent texts, ensuring that both the user delegating a task and the delegatee receiving it acknowledge and agree to these terms.

The user consent will be displayed whenever the delegator (user) goes to their settings in their Workspace and assigns a delegation to an end-user (delegatee). This consent will be recorded in the Cymmetri backend for audit logging purposes.

Similarly, the assignee consent will be recorded when the end-user (delegatee/assignee) logs into the account for their manager (delegator/user).&#x20;

Here's how it works:

1. **Administrator Configuration:** Administrators can craft consent texts tailored to their organization's requirements. These texts typically outline the responsibilities, expectations, and any legal or compliance aspects associated with task delegation.
2. **User Perspective:** When a user decides to delegate a task to someone else, they will be presented with the customized consent text. The user must carefully review and accept the terms before proceeding with the delegation process. This step ensures that the user is aware of the implications of task delegation and is willing to proceed.
3. **Assignee Perspective:** On the other side, the delegatee who is about to receive the delegated task will also be presented with relevant consent text. They must thoroughly read and accept these terms before taking on the responsibility. This step helps establish clarity and accountability for the delegatee.
