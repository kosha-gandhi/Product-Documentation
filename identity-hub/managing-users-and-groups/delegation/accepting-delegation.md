# Accepting Delegation

Upon receiving a delegation request, the user is notified via email and within the platform.&#x20;

To view the delegated task the delegatee can go to **Settings->Delegation** to Me to see details about the delegated tasks and the user who has assigned the task

The user needs to click on the Accept button to accept the delegation. On clicking the Accept button an Assignee(delegatee) Consent is shown which the users need to read and confirm. The Consent also shows details of the delegator and the duration of the delegation.

The delegatee can access and perform actions on all the applications assigned to them and if any application is excluded during delegation they are not visible to the delegatee.
