Administrator tasks pertaining to bulk users may be eased by creating groups of users.

### **Creating User Groups**

Click on the “**+Add New**” button to start creating a new group

**Group Name:** Indicates the name of the group.

**Group Type:** For environments not using Active Directory, either Local or Remote Group may be chosen. In case Active Directory is being used for synchronization in the tenant, the appropriate type according to the group policy object must be chosen.

**Parent Group:** If a parent group is chosen, all the policies and rules applicable to the parent group will be assigned to this new group, in addition to the policies and rules specifically applied to this new group.

**Group Description:** Optionally, a description may be provided to the group.
