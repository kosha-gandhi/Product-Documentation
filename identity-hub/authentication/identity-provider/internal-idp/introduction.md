# Introduction

Cymmetri's Internal Identity Provider (IDP) is a powerful authentication solution that supports seamless integration with various Identity Providers (IDPs).&#x20;

We will explore the configuration options for three types of IDPs:&#x20;

* Cymmetri,&#x20;
* Active Directory, and&#x20;
* LDAP.&#x20;

The flexibility of the Cymmetri Internal IDP allows you to manage multiple IDPs of the same type, making it easy to adapt to diverse environments with different Active Directory/ LDAP instances.  Cymmetri's  Internal IDP aims to provide a centralized and adaptable authentication solution for your environment, supporting various IDP types.

To access Internal Identity Providers navigate to **Authentication-> Identity Provider->Internal IDP**

To customize the applicability of different IDPs, administrators need to configure [Authentication Rules](../../authentication-rules.md). These rules enable the configuration of various conditions. When these conditions are met, the corresponding authentication mechanism or IDP is used for user authentication.
