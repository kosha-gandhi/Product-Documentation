# Attribute Setting

In Cymmetri, the Attribute Setting is a tool for user attribute management.

It provides administrators with granular control over attribute visibility during user creation or updation processes. This feature empowers administrators to enable or disable both predefined and custom attributes effortlessly.&#x20;

When an attribute is disabled, that associated field doesn't appear anywhere in the user creation or updation pages, streamlining the user management experience.&#x20;
