# Dashboard

The Dashboard under My Workspace is the default page once the user has logged in to Cymmetri. This page is accessible to all users in Cymmetri. &#x20;

Cymmetri assigns a basic user role to all users in the system by default. Users with such a role will be able to view the screen as shown below:&#x20;

### Dashboard: Recently Used Applications&#x20;

The user sees a summary of recently accessed applications. Clicking on any of these applications will result in Single Sign-On (SSO) to the chosen application. If the user has not accessed any applications recently, the system will display 'No recent apps'.

### Dashboard: Access Expiring &#x20;

The user receives notifications when their access to certain applications is set to be automatically revoked after a specified period. The applications listed in this section have access times defined for the user and are not granted as lifetime access.&#x20;
