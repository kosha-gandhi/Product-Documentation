The Team Page in My Workspace empowers managers to have a holistic view of their team's access and permissions within the organization. This documentation covers the essential features and functionalities available on the Team Page.

### Applications&#x20;

In the Applications Section, managers can view applications that are already assigned to their team members. This provides a clear overview of the software and systems each team member can access.

Managers also have the capability to assign access to applications directly from this section. This streamlined process simplifies application management and ensures that team members have the right tools to perform their roles effectively.
