# Introduction

Cymmetri allows all users to be able to perform self-service actions such as Single Sign-On, Password Reset, MFA Reset, Approve Access request for other users, Re-certification approvals, and Team Configurations among others.  \
Cymmetri's  My Workspace is the central console where such user actions can be performed from. &#x20;

## User Navigation &#x20;

In Cymmetri's My Workspace section, users can navigate to various other sections using the navigation panel located on the left side on the Dashboard.

Administrators, with their privileged access, have an extended menu section labeled 'Admin' situated above the standard 'My Workspace' menu.
