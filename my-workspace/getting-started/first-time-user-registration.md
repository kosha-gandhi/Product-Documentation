4. Cymmetri will require the user to change the initial password and provide a new password. If the new password provided by user does not match or does not satisfy the password policy, the user will not be able to reset the password and the Update button will not be clickable.  &#x20;

5.  After the user has reset the initial password successfully, if Multi-Factor Authentication is configured for the user, Cymmetri asks the user to register for Multi-Factor Authentication using the Cymmetri Authenticator. The system will guide the user to setup their MFA.  <br>
