# Introduction to Privilege Access Management (PAM)

Privileged Access Management (PAM) is a set of technologies, policies, and procedures used to manage and monitor access to critical systems and sensitive data within an organization. PAM solutions aim to mitigate the risk of unauthorized access to privileged accounts, which are often used by administrators, IT staff, and other privileged users to manage critical systems and applications.

The goal of PAM is to ensure that privileged access is only granted to authorized users, and that access is granted on a need-to-know basis.&#x20;

PAM solutions typically involve several components, including privileged account discovery, credential management, access control, session management, and monitoring and reporting.

* Credential Management involves securely storing and rotating passwords and other credentials used to access privileged accounts.&#x20;
* Access control involves implementing policies and procedures to control who has access to privileged accounts and when.&#x20;
* Session management involves monitoring and terminating privileged sessions to prevent unauthorized access and misuse.&#x20;
* Monitoring and reporting involves tracking all privileged access activity and generating alerts when suspicious activity is detected.

Implementing a robust PAM solution can help organizations improve their security posture, reduce the risk of data breaches, and comply with regulatory requirements.&#x20;

However, PAM solutions require careful planning and implementation to ensure they do not disrupt business operations or create additional security risks.
