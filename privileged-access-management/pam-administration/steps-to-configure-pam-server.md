# Steps to configure PAM Server

The first section in PAM is **Configuration**. In this section we can configure the **PAM server** credentials that will help us to connect to the PAM server.

A **PAM server** is a component of a Privileged Access Management (PAM) solution that is responsible for managing privileged access to critical systems and applications within an organization. The PAM server acts as a central point of control for managing and monitoring privileged accounts and their access.

PAM servers can be deployed on-premises, in the cloud, or as a hybrid solution. They can also be integrated with other security and IT management solutions, such as identity and access management (IAM) systems like Cymmetri.

To configure the PAM Server we need to provide the **IP Address** and **Port No** of the PAM server as shown below:
