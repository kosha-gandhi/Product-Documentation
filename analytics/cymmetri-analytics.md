This feature allows users to tailor reports according to specific needs, combine different data sources, and build interactive dashboards to visualize and analyze data as required. Shown below is one of the Custom Dashboard containing user specific visualization:

To these custom dashboards the user can add new or edit existing filters to further customize data as shown below:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (747).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The Add/ Edit Filter page appears as shown below where the various parameters can be added for filtering data:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (748).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

For creating a custom Dashboard the user needs to open the Dashboard Page and then click on the **New Dashboard** button. Once clicked it shows the **untitled dashboard** Page where the user may add multiple charts:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (751).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

When the user clicks on **New Chart** button the **Create a new chart** page appears:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (752).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

For creating a new chart the user either needs to select an existing dataset or create a new data. This dataset needs to have a unique name and the user needs to select an existing database, then a particular schema in that database and finally a table in the above selected schema. Once the table is selected the user may click on **CREATE DATASET AND CREATE CHART** button to create a new Dataset. The same is shown in the image below:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (750).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Once the dataset is either selected or a new dataset is created the user comes back to the Create Chart page where the user needs to select a chart type and the click on the **CREATE NEW CHART** button:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (754).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Once the chart selection is done the Create a new chart page appears which can be used create a custom chart:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (755).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Here the user may select the required options and create there custom chart as shown below, once created the user may click on the save button:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (756).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The user needs to provide a unique chart name and need to select the dashboard to which the chart needs to be added.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (757).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

_Note: If the chart is directly created and thereis no dashboard then the user has an option on the **Save** page to create a new dashboard._

Once the dashboard is saved, it remains in draft mode. The saved dashboard looks something like this:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (758).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The user may then publish the dashboard for the custom dashboard to be visible to all other users:
