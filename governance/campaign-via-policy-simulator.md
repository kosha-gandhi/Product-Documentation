# Campaign via Policy Simulator

Cymmetri offers a seamless integration between its Policy Simulator and Access Review Campaigns, allowing administrators to transform policy violations into actionable governance initiatives. This powerful feature streamlines the process of enforcing security policies and remediating non-compliant access rights.

#### Methodology

The process begins with the administrator defining and running a policy within the Policy Simulator. This policy serves as a powerful diagnostic tool, automatically identifying and reporting on entitlements that violate predefined security rules.

Once the simulation is complete, the administrator is presented with a comprehensive report of all identified policy violations. From this report, the administrator can directly initiate an access review campaign. Cymmetri automatically extracts the list of non-compliant users and their specific entitlements from the report, using this data to pre-populate the campaign. This eliminates the need for manual data transfer and reduces the risk of human error.

The newly created campaign is then executed, routing the review requests to the appropriate approvers. This integration ensures a direct and efficient path from policy identification to remediation, enabling organizations to proactively address security vulnerabilities and maintain a continuously secure and compliant identity environment.
