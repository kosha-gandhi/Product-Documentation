# TOTP Based

Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) authentication is a two-factor authentication mechanism that uses a time-based algorithm to generate a unique one-time password for user authentication. TOTP is commonly used in security systems, including various two-factor authentication (2FA) applications and services.

In Cymmetri the totp is received on the users mobile device during the login attempt after having it been configured during first login.&#x20;

During login the user is shown the option of Passwordless if it has been enabled by the admin user.
