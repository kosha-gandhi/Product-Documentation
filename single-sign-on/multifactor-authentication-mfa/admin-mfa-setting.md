# Admin MFA Setting

Admin MFA settings has been specifically designed to enhance security of administrative users by requiring a mandatory second-level authentication like Cymmetri Authenticator, Google Authenticator, Push Authenticator, SMS Authenticator, or Secret Questions. This extra layer of protection helps safeguard sensitive administrative logins, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and potential security breaches.

### Configuration

When configuring Admin MFA Setting administrators can choose the MFA Type  from one of the following: Cymmetri Authenticator, Google Authenticator, Push Authenticator, SMS Authenticator, or Secret Questions and ensure that status is set to enabled.

Enabling Admin MFA ensures that administrators are always asked for a second level of authentication when they login into Cymmetri.
