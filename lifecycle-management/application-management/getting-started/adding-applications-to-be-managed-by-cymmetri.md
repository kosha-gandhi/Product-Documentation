### Understanding the applications supported by Cymmetri

Applications supported by the Cymmetri platform fall majorly into three categories -&#x20;

1. **Pre-configured Applications**\
   These are the applications that have already been configured by the Cymmetri platform for provisioning on cloud or on-premises.&#x20;
2. **Custom Applications for Provisioning**\
   These are the applications that you wish to manage through Cymmetri and support the generic connectors that the Cymmetri platform provides.&#x20;
3. **Custom Applications for Single SignOn only**\
   When you need to add an application for the sole purpose of enabling Single Sign-On (SSO), Cymmetri offers the capability to add a custom application that can be configured for SSO using the supported mechanisms.

### Adding Application

Once you have chosen the application to be added from the above categories, you are ready to add a new application.
