# Managing Manual Application Assignments

Cymmetri can work with systems that handle user account provisioning manually, such as help desk or service request platforms. These systems typically rely on human intervention to create, modify, or deactivate user accounts, and Cymmetri can communicate or integrate with them to streamline these processes.

For example: If a company hires a new employee, the help desk team manually creates an account for the employee. Cymmetri connects with this help desk system to track or manage the account creation process.
