# 360 Degree Comparison Report

Cymmetri’s 360-Degree Reconciliation feature provides a robust solution for ensuring data integrity and consistency across your organization’s identity landscape. This functionality involves pulling user and role information from various applications connected to the Cymmetri platform. This collected data is then compared against your organization's primary Source of Truth (e.g., HRMS) and the Cymmetri identity store.

Key Capabilities and Benefits

This feature provides a holistic, 360-degree view of user entitlements, allowing administrators to easily identify and rectify discrepancies. It facilitates several critical reporting and security scenarios, including:

* Identity Discrepancy Reporting: The system can generate reports highlighting users who exist in the source application but are not present in the Cymmetri identity store or a target application. This helps identify onboarding failures or synchronization issues.
* Entitlement Mismatch Analysis: It provides a comprehensive comparison of user entitlements (roles, permissions, etc.) across multiple applications. This allows for the easy identification of unauthorized access or provisioning errors, such as a user having a role in one application but not in another where it is required, or vice versa.
* Enhanced Audit and Compliance: By providing a single, consolidated view of all user entitlements, the feature significantly streamlines audit processes. It ensures that user access aligns with established policies and helps maintain a secure posture by highlighting potential security risks.
