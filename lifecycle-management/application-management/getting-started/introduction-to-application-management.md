#### &#x20;Single Sign On

Single Sign On is the process of ensuring that once an end user is logged onto the Cymmetri Identity platform, they should be able to seamlessly move their session to any of your applications managed by your Cymmetri Identity platform deployment. Use the FAQ to learn how to configure Single Sign On for your application.

#### &#x20;Managing the Application Sign-On Policy

Modern IAM deployments wishing to have progressive authentication may require some critical application integrations within your deployment to perform additional authentication while performing Single Sign On for the end user. Use the FAQ to learn how to configure the Application Sign On Policy.

#### &#x20;Provisioning

Provisioning refers to the process of creating, modifying, and, in general, pushing the user account information stored on the Cymmetri Identity platform to the applications managed by your Cymmetri Identity platform deployment. Use the FAQ to learn how to configure User Account Provisioning.

#### &#x20;Reconciliation

Reconciliation of User accounts is a primary activity in Identity Governance, which allows for synchronisation between the user account information on the managed application and the Cymmetri Identity platform deployments, including provisioning, modifying, deprovisioning, and modifying user account attributes based on various synchronisation states. Use the FAQ to learn how to configure the Identity Reconciliation Process.

#### &#x20;Assigning Application

Once an application has been added to the Cymmetri Identity platform deployment and the necessary configurations for Single Sign On, Provisioning, and Reconciliation have been performed, an application may be assigned to an individual user or to a group of users.
